This guide will take you through the basics of creating and using parameters in OFX.  An example plugin will be used to illustrate 
how it all works and its source can be found in the pass:[C++] 
file `GuideExamples/Gain/gain.cpp`. 
This plugin takes an image and multiplies the pixel by the value held in a user visible parameter.
Ideally you should have read the guide to the link:ofxExample2_invert.html[basic image processing] before you read this guide.

== Parameters
Host applications need parameters to make their own effects work. Such as the size of a blur effect, colours to apply to some text, 
a point for the centre of a lens flare and so on. The host app will use
some widget set to present a user interface for the parameter, have ways to do undo/redo, saving/loading, manage animation
etc...

The OFX parameters suite is the bridge from a plugin to the host's native parameter set. So plugin devs don't have to do all
that work for themselves and also get the other advantages a host's parameters system may give (e.g. scripting). 

The way it works is fairly simple in concept, we get a plugin to tell the host what parameters it wants during description.
When an instance is created, the host will make whatever
native data structures it needs to manage those params. The plugin can then grab values from the various parameters to
do what it needs to do during various actions, it can even write back to parameters under certain conditions.

Our simple gain example will make two parameters, a parameter that is of type `**double**` which is the gain amount and a `**bool**` param
which controls whether to apply the gain amount to the Alpha of an RGBA image. There are more parameter types, and quite
a few properties you can set on a param to control how it should behave in a host application. The current parameter types available are...

  - double - 1, 2 or 3D double precision floating point parameters, footnote:[the API manages all floating point params as doubles, the host could be
using 32 bit floats, or fixed precision for that matter, so long as the values are passed back and forth over the API as doubles, all will be fine]
  - integers - 1, 2 or 3D,
  - colour parameters,
  - boolean parameters,
  - 'choice' parameters (where the user gets to choise 1-of-N options),
  - string parameters,
  - parametric parameters (which can be used for lookup tables and so on),
  - custom parameters (where you manage all the parameter state and UI yourself).

There are several UI elements that are described with pseudo parameters, these are...

  - push buttons - to have the plugin do something when the user tells it (eg: analyse and image and set some params),
  - group params - to organise params in a scrolling type UI,
  - page params - for hosts that have a paged parameter layout as opposed to a scrolling UI.

NOTE: A key concept in OFX is that the state of a plugin instance is totally and uniquely defined by the value of its parameters and input clips. 
You are asking for trouble if you try and store important data in separate files and so on. The host won't be able to properly know when things have 
changed, how to manage that extra data and so on. Attempting to manage data outside of the parameter set will almost certainly cause hosts
to lose track of the correct render and you will get angry users.
This is a fundamental aspect of the API. If it isn't in a parameter, it is going to cause problems with the host if you rely on it.

== Actions
This example doesn't trap any actions you haven't already seen in the other examples, it just does a little bit more in them.
Seeing as you should be familiar with how the main entry point works, I won't bother with the code listing from now on. The actions
our plugin traps are now ...

  - kOfxActionLoad - to grab suites from the host,
  - kOfxActionDescribe and kOfxImageEffectActionDescribeInContext - to describe the plugin to the host, __including parameters__,
  - kOfxActionCreateInstance and kOfxActionDestroyInstance - to create and destroy instance data, where we cache handles to clips and parameters,
  - kOfxImageEffectActionIsIdentity - to check if the parameter values are at their defaults and so the plugin can be ignore by the host,
  - kOfxImageEffectActionRender - to actually process pixels.

Now seeing as we are going to be playing with parameters, our plugin will need a new suite, the parameters suite, and our load action now looks like...

[source, c++]
.gain.cpp
----
  OfxPropertySuiteV1    *gPropertySuite    = 0;
  OfxImageEffectSuiteV1 *gImageEffectSuite = 0;
  OfxParameterSuiteV1   *gParameterSuite   = 0;

  ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
  // get the named suite and put it in the given pointer, with error checking
  template <class SUITE>
  void FetchSuite(SUITE *& suite, const char *suiteName, int suiteVersion)
  {
    suite = (SUITE *) gHost->fetchSuite(gHost->host, suiteName, suiteVersion);
    if(!suite) {
      ERROR_ABORT_IF(suite == NULL, 
                     "Failed to fetch %s verison %d from the host.", 
                     suiteName, 
                     suiteVersion);
    }
  }

  ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
  // The first _action_ called after the binary is loaded 
  OfxStatus LoadAction(void)
  {
    // fetch our three suites
    FetchSuite(gPropertySuite,    kOfxPropertySuite,    1);
    FetchSuite(gImageEffectSuite, kOfxImageEffectSuite, 1);
    FetchSuite(gParameterSuite,   kOfxParameterSuite,   1);

    return kOfxStatOK;
  }
----

You can see I've written a `**FetchSuite**` function, as I got bored of writing the same code over and over. We are now fetching the a
suite of type `**OfxParameterSuiteV1**` which is defined in the header file **ofxParam.h**. footnote:[The suite is completely independent of the image effect suite and could happily
be used to describe parameters to other types of plugins].

== Describing Our Plugin

We have the standard two step description process for this plugin. The Describe action is almost exactly the same as in our previous 
examples, some names and labels have been changed is all, so I won't list it. However, the describe in context action has a few more things going on.

In the listings below I've chopped out the code to describe clips, as it is exactly the same as in the last example. What's new is the bit
where we describe parameters. I'll show the describe in context action in several small chunks to take you through it.

[source, c++]
.gain.cpp
----
  OfxStatus
  DescribeInContextAction(OfxImageEffectHandle descriptor,
                          OfxPropertySetHandle inArgs)
  {
    ...
    BIG SNIP OF EXACTLY THE SAME CODE IN THE LAST EXAMPLE
    ...

    // first get the handle to the parameter set 
    OfxParamSetHandle paramSet;
    gImageEffectSuite->getParamSet(descriptor, &paramSet);

    // properties on our parameter
    OfxPropertySetHandle paramProps;

    // now define a 'gain' parameter and set its properties
    gParameterSuite->paramDefine(paramSet, 
                                 kOfxParamTypeDouble, 
                                 GAIN_PARAM_NAME, 
                                 &paramProps);
----

The first thing we do is to grab a `**OfxParamSetHandle**` from the effect descriptor. This object represents all the
parameters attached to a plugin and is independent and orthogonal to an image effect. 

The parameter suite is then used to define a parameter on that parameter set. In this case its type is double,
and its name is "gain". These are the two most important things for a parameter. 

NOTE: The name uniquely identifies that parameter within the API, so no two parameters can have the same name.

The last argument to `**paramDefine**` is an optional pointer to the new parameter's property set
handle. Each parameter has a set of properties we use to refine its behaviour, most of which have
sensible defaults.

[source, c++]
.gain.cpp
----
    gPropertySuite->propSetString(paramProps,
                                  kOfxParamPropDoubleType, 
                                  0,
                                  kOfxParamDoubleTypeScale);
----

The first property on our 'gain' param we set is the kind of double parameter it is. Many host
applications have different kind of double parameters and user interfaces that make working with
them easier. For example a parameter used to control a rotation might have a little dial in the UI
to spin the angle, a 2D position parameter might get cross hairs over the image and so on. In this
case we are saying that our double parameter represents a scaling value. OFX has more kinds of
double parameter which you can use to best for your effect.

[source, c++]
.gain.cpp
----
    gPropertySuite->propSetDouble(paramProps, 
                                  kOfxParamPropDefault,
                                  0,
                                  1.0);
    gPropertySuite->propSetDouble(paramProps,
                                  kOfxParamPropMin,
                                  0,
                                  0.0);
----

This section sets a default value for our parameter and a logical a minimum value below which it cannot go. Note
it does not set a maximum value, so the parameter should not be clamped to any upper value ever.

[source, c++]
.gain.cpp
----
    gPropertySuite->propSetDouble(paramProps,
                                  kOfxParamPropDisplayMin,
                                  0,
                                  0.0);
    gPropertySuite->propSetDouble(paramProps,
                                  kOfxParamPropDisplayMax,
                                  0,
                                  10.0);
----

Numbers are often manipulated with sliders widgets in user interfaces, and it is useful to set a range on those sliders. Which
is exactly what we are doing here. This is distinct to the logical mimimum and maximum values, so you can set a 'useful' range
for the UI, but still allow the values to be outside that range. So here a slider would only allow values between 0.0 and 10.0
for our gain param, but the parameter could be set to a million via other means, eg: typing in a UI number box, animation, scripting
whatever.

[source, c++]
.gain.cpp
----
    gPropertySuite->propSetString(paramProps,
                                  kOfxPropLabel,
                                  0,
                                  "Gain");
    gPropertySuite->propSetString(paramProps,
                                  kOfxParamPropHint,
                                  0,
                                  "How much to multiply the image by.");
----
Here we are setting two text field on the param. The first is a label for the parameter. This is to be used in any UI the host
has to label the parameter. It defaults to the name of the param, but it can be entirely different. Finally we set a hint string
to be used for the parameter. 

[source, c++]
.gain.cpp
----
    // and define the 'applyToAlpha' parameters and set its properties
    gParameterSuite->paramDefine(paramSet,
                                 kOfxParamTypeBoolean,
                                 APPLY_TO_ALPHA_PARAM_NAME,
                                 &paramProps);
    gPropertySuite->propSetInt(paramProps,
                               kOfxParamPropDefault,
                               0,
                               0);
    gPropertySuite->propSetString(paramProps,
                                  kOfxParamPropHint,
                                  0,
                                  "Whether to apply the gain value to alpha as well.");
    gPropertySuite->propSetString(paramProps,
                                  kOfxPropLabel,
                                  0,
                                  "Apply To Alpha");

    return kOfxStatOK;
  }
----

In this last section we define a second parameter, named "applyToAlpha", which is of type boolean. We then
set some obvious state on it and we are done. Notice the label we set, it is much clearer to read than the name.

And that's it, we've defined two parameters for our plugin. There are many more properties you can set
on your plugin to control how they behave and to give hints as to what you are going to do to them.

Finally, the image above shows the control panel for an instance of our example inside Nuke. 

== Instances and Parameters

When the host creates an instance of the plugin, it will first create all the native data structures it
needs to represent the plugin, fully populate them with the required values, and only then call the create 
instance action. 

So what happens in the create instance action then? Possibly nothing, you can always grab parameters from
an instance by name at any time. But to make our code a bit cleaner and to show an example of instance data
being used, we are going to trap create instance.

[source, c++]
.gain.cpp
----
  ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
  // our instance data, where we are caching away clip and param handles
  struct MyInstanceData {
    // handles to the clips we deal with
    OfxImageClipHandle sourceClip;
    OfxImageClipHandle outputClip;
    
    // handles to a our parameters
    OfxParamHandle gainParam;
    OfxParamHandle applyToAlphaParam;
  };
----

To stop duplicating code all over, and to minimise fetches to various handles, we are going to cache
away handles to our clips and parameters in a simple struct. Note that these handles are valid for the duration
of the instance.

[source, c++]
.gain.cpp
----
  ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
  /// instance construction
  OfxStatus CreateInstanceAction( OfxImageEffectHandle instance)
  {
    OfxPropertySetHandle effectProps;
    gImageEffectSuite->getPropertySet(instance, &effectProps);

    // To avoid continual lookup, put our handles into our instance
    // data, those handles are guaranteed to be valid for the duration
    // of the instance.
    MyInstanceData *myData = new MyInstanceData;

    // Set my private instance data
    gPropertySuite->propSetPointer(effectProps, kOfxPropInstanceData, 0, (void *) myData);
    
    // Cache the source and output clip handles
    gImageEffectSuite->clipGetHandle(instance, "Source", &myData->sourceClip, 0);
    gImageEffectSuite->clipGetHandle(instance, "Output", &myData->outputClip, 0);
  
    // Cache away the param handles
    OfxParamSetHandle paramSet;
    gImageEffectSuite->getParamSet(instance, &paramSet);
    gParameterSuite->paramGetHandle(paramSet,
                                    GAIN_PARAM_NAME,
                                    &myData->gainParam,
                                    0);
    gParameterSuite->paramGetHandle(paramSet, 
                                    APPLY_TO_ALPHA_PARAM_NAME, 
                                    &myData->applyToAlphaParam,
                                    0);

    return kOfxStatOK;
  }
----

So here is the function called when we trap a create instance action. You can see that it allocates a
MyInstanceData struct and caches it away in the instance's property set. 

It then fetches handles to the two clips and two parameters by name and caches those into the
newly created struct.

[source, c++]
.gain.cpp
----
  ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
  // get my instance data from a property set handle
  MyInstanceData *FetchInstanceData(OfxPropertySetHandle effectProps)
  {
    MyInstanceData *myData = 0;
    gPropertySuite->propGetPointer(effectProps,  
                                   kOfxPropInstanceData, 
                                   0, 
                                   (void **) &myData);
    return myData;
  }
----

And here is a simple function to fetch instance data. It is actually overloaded and there is another version
that take an `**OfxImageEffectHandle**`.

Of course we now need to trap the destroy instance action to delete our instance data, otherwise we
will get memory leaks.

[source, c++]
.gain.cpp
----
  ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
  // instance destruction
  OfxStatus DestroyInstanceAction( OfxImageEffectHandle instance)
  {
    // get my instance data
    MyInstanceData *myData = FetchInstanceData(instance);
    delete myData;

    return kOfxStatOK;
  }
----

== Getting Values From Instances

So we've define our parameters, we've got handles to the instance of them, but we will want to grab
the value of the parameters to actually use them at render time. 

[source, c++]
.gain.cpp
----
  ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
  // Render an output image
  OfxStatus RenderAction( OfxImageEffectHandle instance,
                          OfxPropertySetHandle inArgs,
                          OfxPropertySetHandle outArgs)
  {
    // get the render window and the time from the inArgs
    OfxTime time;
    OfxRectI renderWindow;
    OfxStatus status = kOfxStatOK;
  
    gPropertySuite->propGetDouble(inArgs, kOfxPropTime, 0, &time);
    gPropertySuite->propGetIntN(inArgs, kOfxImageEffectPropRenderWindow, 4, &renderWindow.x1);
    
    // get our instance data which has out clip and param handles
    MyInstanceData *myData = FetchInstanceData(instance);

    // get our param values
    double gain = 1.0;
    int applyToAlpha = 0;
    gParameterSuite->paramGetValueAtTime(myData->gainParam, time, &gain);
    gParameterSuite->paramGetValueAtTime(myData->applyToAlphaParam, time, &applyToAlpha);

....

----

We are using the `**paramGetValueAtTime**` suite function to get the value of our parameters for the
given time we are rendering at. Nearly all actions passed to an instance will have a time to perform
the instance at, you should use this when fetching values out of a param.

The param get value functions use var-args to return values to plugins, similar to a C scanf function.

And finally here is a snippet of the templated pixel pushing code where we do the actuall processing using
our parameter values;

[source, c++]
.gain.cpp
---- 
    // and do some processing
    for(int y = renderWindow.y1; y < renderWindow.y2; y++) {
      if(y % 20 == 0 && gImageEffectSuite->abort(instance)) break;

      // get the row start for the output image
      T *dstPix = pixelAddress<T>(renderWindow.x1, y, 
                                  dstPtr, 
                                  dstBounds, 
                                  dstRowBytes, 
                                  nComps);

      for(int x = renderWindow.x1; x < renderWindow.x2; x++) {
        
        // get the source pixel
        T *srcPix = pixelAddress<T>(x, y, 
                                    srcPtr, 
                                    srcBounds,
                                    srcRowBytes,
                                    nComps);

        if(srcPix) {
          // we have one, iterate each component in the pixels
          for(int i = 0; i < nComps; ++i) {
            if(i != 3 || applyToAlpha) { 
              // multiply our source component by our gain value
              double value = *srcPix * gain;

              // if it has gone out of legal bounds, clamp it
              if(MAX != 1) {  // we let floating point pixels over and underflow
                value = value < 0 ? 0 : (value > MAX ? MAX : value);
              }
              *dstPix = T(value);
            }
            else {
              *dstPix = *srcPix;
            }
            // increment to next component
            ++dstPix; ++srcPix;
          }
        }
        else {
          // we don't have a pixel in the source image, set output to zero
          for(int i = 0; i < nComps; ++i) {
            *dstPix = 0;
            ++dstPix;
          }          
        }
      }
    }
----
Notice that we are checking to see if `MAX != 1`, which means our pixels are not floating point. If
that is the case, we are clamping the pixel's value so we don't get integer overflow.

== Summary
This plugin has shown you the basics of working with OFX parameters, the main things it illustrated were...

   - defining parameters in the define in context action,
   - setting properties to control the behaviour of parameters,
   - using the instance data pointer to cache away handles to instances of parameters and clips,
   - fetching values of a parameter from parameter instance handles and using them to process pixels.
