        <title>Interpreting the OfxPlugin Struct</title>

        <para>When a host gets a pointer back from OfxGetPlugin, it examines
        the string <structfield>pluginApi</structfield>. This identifies what
        kind of plug-in it is. Currently there is only one publicly specified
        API that uses the OFX mechanism, this is
        <literal>"OfxImageEffectPluginAPI"</literal>, which is the image
        effect API being discussed by this book. More APIs may be created at a
        future date, for example "OfxImageImportPluginAPI". Knowing the type
        of plug-in, the host then knows what suites and host handles are
        required for that plug-in and what functions the plug-in itself will
        have. The host passes a <structname>OfxHost</structname> structure
        appropriate to that plug-in via it's <function>setHost</function>
        function. This allows for the same basic architecture to support
        different plug-in types trivially.</para>

        <para>OFX explicitly versions plug-in APIs. By examining the
        <structfield>apiVersion</structfield>, the host knows exactly what set
        of functions the plug-in is going to supply and what version of what
        suites it will need to provide. This also allows plug ins to implement
        several versions of themselves in the same binary, so it can take
        advantages of new features in a V2 API, but present a V1 plug-in to
        older hosts that only support V1.</para>

        <para>If a host does not support the given plug-in type, or it does
        not support the given version it should simply ignore that
        plug-in.</para>

        <para>A plug-in needs to uniquely identify itself to a host. This is
        the job of <structfield>pluginIdentifier</structfield>. This null
        terminated ASCII C string should be unique among all plug-ins, it is
        not necessarily meant to convey a sensible name to an end user. The
        recommended format is the reverse domain name format of the developer,
        for example "uk.co.thefoundry", followed by the developer's unique
        name for the plug-in. e.g. "uk.co.thefoundry.F_Kronos".</para>

        <para>A plug-in (as opposed to the API it implements) is versioned
        with two separate integers in the <structname>OfxPlugin</structname>
        struct. They serve two separate functions and are, <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <structfield>pluginVersionMajor</structfield>
               flags the functionality contained within a plug-in, incrementing this number means that you have broken backwards compatibility of the plug-in. More specifically, this means a setup from an earlier version, when loaded into this version, will not yield the same result. 
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <structfield>pluginVersionMinor</structfield>
               flags the release of a plug-in that does not break backwards compatibility, but otherwise enhances that plug-in. For example, increment this when you have fixed a bug or made it faster. 
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist></para>

        <para>If a host encounters multiple versions of the same plug-in it
        should, <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
               when creating a brand new instance, always use the version of a plug-in with the greatest major and minor version numbers, 
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
               when loading a setup, always use the plug-in with the major version that matches the setup, but has the greatest minor number. 
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist></para>

        <para>A more concrete example of versioning, the plug-in identified by
        "org.wibble:Fred" is initially released as 1.0, however a few months
        later, wibble.org figured out how to make it faster and release it as
        1.1. A year later, Fred can now do automatically what a user once
        needed to set five parameters up to do, thus making it much simpler to
        use. However this breaks backwards compatibility as the effect can no
        longer produce the same output as before, so wibble.org then release
        this as v2.0.</para>

        <para>A user's host might now have three versions of the Fred plug-in
        on it, v1.0, v1.1 and v2.0. When creating a new instance of the
        plug-in, the host should always use v2.0. When loading an old project
        which has a setup from a v1.x plug-in, it should always use the
        latest, in this case being v1.1</para>

        <para>Note that plug-ins can change the set of parameters between
        minor version releases. If a plug-in does so, it should do so in a
        backwards compatible manner, such that the default value of any new
        parameter would yield the same results as previously. See the chapter
        below about parameters.</para>
