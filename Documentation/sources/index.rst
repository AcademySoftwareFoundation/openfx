Welcome to OpenFX documentation
===============================

The OpenFX documentation is organized as follows:

- The :doc:`programming guide<Guide/index>` contains everything to get started with OpenFX to create a new plug-in or host application
- The :doc:`reference guide<Reference/index>` contains the full reference documentation about the OpenFX protocol and design
- The :doc:`release notes<ReleaseNotes/index>` contains release notes, documenting changes in recent OpenFX releases.

This documentation is also
`available online <https://docs.openeffects.org>`__.
