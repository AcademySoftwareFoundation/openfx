This is a brief description of examples which could
do with being added to the Guides.

The following examples should be added to the guide.

OpenGL Overlay Example
======================
A trivial example along the lines of the circle drawing example.

This will illustrate...
    - openGL overlays


Temporal Difference Example
===========================
Compute the absolute difference between images at two different times.

This will illustrate...
    - fetching images at separate times
    - the get frames needed action

Transition Example
===========================
A simple straight frame blend transition

This will illustrate...
   - the transition context


Custom Parameter
================
Something like the circle drawing plugin so that it has no double parameters, but only a single custom parameter, controlled via the overlay UI.

This will illustrate...
    - using custom parameters.


3x3 2D Filter
=============
Does a variety of simple 2D filtering operations using a 3x3 window.

This will illustrate...
   - the get region of interest action


Analysis Plugin
===============
The plugin will find the minimum and maximum value of a given frame in response to a push button, and store the values
into two parameters. During renders it will rescale pixel values so that 'min' is 0 and 'max' is the whitepoint.

This will illustrate...
    - writing to parameters in response to a button press outside of render.


Basic OpenGL Example
==============
Behaviour to be determined.

This will illustrate the basics of rendering in OpenGL
