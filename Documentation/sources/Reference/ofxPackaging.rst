Packaging OFX Plug-ins
======================

Where a host application chooses to search for OFX plug-ins, what binary
format they are in and any directory hierarchy is entirely up to it.
However, it is strongly recommended that the following scheme be
followed.

Binary Types
------------

Plug-ins should be distributed in the following formats, depending on
the host operating system....

-  Microsoft Windows, as ".dll" dynamically linked libraries,
-  Apple OSX, as binary bundles,
-  LINUX (and other Unix variants), as native dynamic shared objects.

Installation Directory Hierarchy
--------------------------------

Each plug-in binary is distributed as a Mac OS X package style directory
hierarchy. Note that there are two distinct meanings of 'bundle', one
referring to a binary file format, the other to a directory hierarchy
used to distribute software. We are distributing binaries in a bundle
package, and in the case of OSX, the binary is a binary bundle. All the
binaries must end with ``".ofx"``, regardless of the host operating
system.

The directory hierarchy is as follows.....

-  NAME.ofx.bundle

   -  Contents

      -  Info.plist
      -  Resources

         -  NAME.xml
         -  EFFECT_A.png
         -  EFFECT_A.svg
         -  EFFECT_B.png
         -  EFFECT_B.svg
         -  ...

      -  ARCHITECTURE_A

         -  NAME.ofx

      -  ARCHITECTURE_B

         -  NAME.ofx

      -  ...
      -  ARCHITECTURE_N

         -  NAME.ofx

Where...

-  Info.plist is relevant for OSX only and needs to be filled in
   appropriately,
-  NAME is the file name you want the installed plug-in to be identified
   by,
-  EFFECT_N.png - is an optional PNG image file image to use as an
   icon for the effect in the plug-in binary which has a matching
   ``pluginIdentifier``
   field in the
   ``OfxPlugin``
   struct,
-  EFFECT_N.svg - is an optional scalable vector graphic file to use as an
   icon for the plug-in in the binary which has a matching
   ``pluginIdentifier``
   field in the
   ``OfxPlugin``
   struct,
-  ARCHITECTURE is the specific operating system architecture the
   plug-in was built for, these are currently...

   -  ``MacOS`` - for Apple Macintosh OS X universal or architecture-specific binaries
   -  ``MacOS-x86-64`` - *DEPRECATED*. Formerly used for Intel Macs during the transition from PowerPC.
   -  ``Win32`` - for Microsoft Windows (Intel x86, 32 bit)
   -  ``Win64`` - for Microsoft Windows (Intel x64, 64 bit)
   -  ``Win-arm64ec`` - for Microsoft Windows (ARM64EC)
   -  ``Win-arm64`` - for Microsoft Windows (ARM64)
   -  ``Win-arm64x`` - for Microsoft Windows (ARM64X)
   -  ``IRIX`` - for SGI IRIX plug-ins (compiled 32 bit) (*DEPRECATED*)
   -  ``IRIX64`` - for SGI IRIX plug-ins (compiled 64 bit) (*DEPRECATED*)
   -  ``Linux-x86`` - for Linux on x86 CPUs (compiled 32 bit)
   -  ``Linux-x86-64`` - for Linux on x86 CPUs running AMD's 64 bit
      extensions

Note that not all the above architectures need be supported, only the
architectures supported by the host product itself.

MacOS Architectures and Universal Binaries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For MacOS, as of 2024 (OpenFX v1.5), all MacOS plug-ins should be in
``MacOS``, and preferably should be universal binaries (whatever that
means at any given point in time, given the hosts a plug-in is trying
to support). There will not be a specific ``arm64`` folder.

This is acceptable since MacOS supports multi-architecture binaries,
so per-architecture subdirectories are not needed for a host
application to find the proper architecture plug-in. This proposal
would prohibit a plug-in from shipping a separate Intel and arm64
binaries (since the plug-in .ofx file must always be named to match the
top-level bundle name), but it should not be difficult for any plug-in
to merge multiple architectures into a single binary on MacOS.

Windows Architectures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As of 2024, Windows supports Arm64 CPUs. It uses two distinct ABIs,
*Arm64* for native code, and *Arm64EC* for x64/Arm64 compatibility, in
which x64 apps running in emulation on Arm64 hardware can interoperate
with x64 DLLs (also in emulation) or Arm64EC DLLs (which are native
Arm64 code with x64-compatible calling conventions). Arm64EC apps
cannot load native Arm64 DLLs, only Intel or Arm64EC.

Windows also supports an Arm64X "fat" binary PE format which
contains both Intel/Arm64EC and Arm64 binaries.

**Search Order**: Since apps built natively for Arm64 ("Arm64" abi)
can only load Arm64 DLLs, those apps should attempt to load plugins
from the "Win-arm64" folder first, then "Win-arm64x". Arm64EC hosts
(running on an Arm64 system) should try the "Win-arm64ec" folder
first, then "Win-arm64x". Arm64EC hosts can also use x64 DLLs, so they
may try "Win64" as well, but should prefer the other folders to avoid
running the plugin in emulation. An Arm64X host will be running either
its Arm64EC branch or its Arm64 branch depending on how it's launched,
so it should load plugins according to the above depending on the
current mode.

Note that there is no "fat binary" format on Windows that contains
Intel x64 *and* arm64 code.

Future Architecture Compatibility
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NOTE: this section is not yet normative, but informational.

Note that Linux does not support universal binaries. Each
.ofx file is for one architecture, so a host must check the proper
architecture-specific subdir. Windows on Arm64 processors is similar.

When OpenFX apps on Linux support alternative processor architectures
such as arm64, hosts should look in appropriately-named subdirs for
the proper .ofx plugin file. On Linux, hosts should look in the subdir
named by ``Linux-${uname -m}`` which for arm64 should be
``Linux-aarch64``. Using ``uname -m`` rather than a hard-coded list
allows for transparently supporting any future architectures.


Structure
^^^^^^^^^

This directory structure is necessary on OS X, but it also gives a
nice skeleton to hang all other operating systems from in a single
install, as well as a clean place to put resources.

The ``Info.plist`` is specific to Apple and you should consult the Apple
developer's website for more details. It should contain the following
keys:

-  ``CFBundleExecutable`` - the name of the binary bundle in the MacOS
   directory
-  ``CFBundlePackageType`` - to be ``BNDL``
-  ``CFBundleInfoDictionaryVersion``
-  ``CFBundleVersion``
-  ``CFBundleDevelopmentRegion``

.. ArchitectureInstallingLocation:

Installation Location
---------------------

Plug-ins are searched for in a variety of locations, both default and
user specified. All such directories are examined for plug-in bundles
and sub directories are also recursively examined.

A list of directories is supplied in the "OFX_PLUGIN_PATH" environment
variable, these are examined, first to last, for plug-ins, then the
default location is examined.

On Microsoft Windows machines, the plug-ins are searched for in:

1. the ';'-separated directory list specified by the environment
   variable "OFX_PLUGIN_PATH"
2. the directory returned by
   ``getStdOFXPluginPath``
   in the following code snippet:
   ::

       #include "shlobj.h"
       #include "tchar.h"
       const TCHAR *getStdOFXPluginPath(void)
       {
         static TCHAR buffer[MAX_PATH];
         static int gotIt = 0;
         if(!gotIt) {
           gotIt = 1;
           SHGetFolderPath(NULL, CSIDL_PROGRAM_FILES_COMMON, NULL, SHGFP_TYPE_CURRENT, buffer);
           _tcscat(buffer, __T("\\OFX\\Plugins"));
         }
         return buffer;
       }

3. the directory ``C:\Program Files\Common Files\OFX\Plugins``. This
   location is deprecated, and it is returned by the code snippet above
   on English language systems. However it should still be examined by
   hosts for backwards compatibility.

On Apple OSX machines, the plug-ins are searched for in:

1. the ';'-separated directory list specified by the environment
   variable "OFX_PLUGIN_PATH"
2. the directory ``/Library/OFX/Plugins``

On UNIX, Linux and other UNIX like operating systems, the plug-ins are
searched for in:

1. the ':'-separated directory specified by the environment variable
   "OFX_PLUGIN_PATH"
2. the directory ``/usr/OFX/Plugins``

Any bundle or sub-directory name starting with the character '@' is to
be ignored. Such directories or bundles must be skipped by the host.

Plug-in Icons
-------------

Some hosts may wish to display an icon associated with the effects in
a plug-in binary on
their interfaces. Any such icon must be in the Portable Network Graphics
format (see http://www.libpng.org/) and must contain 32 bits of colour,
including an alpha channel. Ideally it should be at least 128x128
pixels.

Note that a single plug-in binary may define more than one effect,
when :ref:`OfxGetNumberOfPlugins<OfxGetNumberOfPlugins>` returns a
value greater than 1. These icons are specific to each effect within
the plug-in, and are named according to what is returned from
:ref:`OfxGetPlugin<OfxGetPlugin>`.

Host applications should dynamically resize the icon to fit their
preferred icon size. The icon should not have its aspect changed,
rather the host should fill with some appropriate colour any blank areas
due to aspect mismatches.

Ideally plug-in developers should not render the plug-in or effect's
name into the icon, as this may be changed by the resource file,
especially for internationalisation purposes. Hosts should thus
present the plug-in and/or effect's name next to the icon in some way.

The icon file must be named as the corresponding ``pluginIdentifier`` field
from the ``OfxPlugin``, postpended with '.png' and be placed in the
resources sub-directory.

Some hosts may use a scalable vector icon if provided; it should be in
SVG format and be named and located just like the ``.png`` icon but
with a ``.svg`` suffix.

Externally Specified Resources
------------------------------

Some plug-ins may supply an externally specified resource file for
particular hosts. Typically this is for tasks such as
internationalising interfaces, tweaking user interfaces for specific
hosts, and so on. These are XML files and have DTD associated with the
specific API, for example OFX Image Effect DTD is found in
``ofx.dtd``.

The XML resource file is installed in the ``Resources`` subdirectory of
the bundle hierarchy. Its name should be ``NAME.xml``, where name is the
base name of the bundle folder and the effect binary.

Plug-ins are free to include other resources in the ``Resources``
subdirectory.
