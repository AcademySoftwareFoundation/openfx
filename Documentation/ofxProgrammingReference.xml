    <title>Foreword</title>
    <para>This is a mostly complete reference guide to the OFX image effect plugin architecture. It is a backwards compatible update to the 1.2 version of the API. The changes to the API are listed in an addendum.

  <chapter><title>Structure of The OFX and the Image Effect API</title>
    <section> <title>The Structure Of The Generic OFX API</title>
      <para>
	OFX is actually several things. At its base it is a generic plug-in architecture which can be used to implement a variety of
	plug-in APIs. The first such API to be implemented on the core architecture is the OFX Image Effect Plug-in API.
      </para>
      
      <para>
	It is all specified using the 'C' programming language. C and C++ are the languages mainly used to write visual effects applications (the initial target for OFX plug-in APIs) and have a very wide adoption across most operating systems with many available compilers. By making the API C, rather than C++, you remove the whole set of problems around C++ symbol mangling between the host and plug-in.
      </para>

      <para>
	APIs are defined in OFX by only a set of C header files and associated documentation. There are no binary libraries for a plug-in or host to link against.
      </para>

      <para>
	Hosts rely on two symbols within a plug-in, all other communication is boot strapped from those two symbols. The plug-in has no symbolic dependancies from the host. This minimal symbolic dependancy allows for run-time determination of what features to provide over the API, making implementation much more flexible and less prone to backwards compatibility problems.
      </para>
      
      <para>
	Plug-ins, via the two exposed symbols, indicate the API they implement, the version of the API, their name, their version and their main entry point.
      </para>

      <para>
	A host communicates with a plug-in via sending 'actions' to the plug-in's main entry function. Actions are C strings that indicate the specific operation to be carried out. They are associated with sets of properties, which allows the main entry function to behave as a generic function.
      </para>

      <para>
	A plug-in communicates with a host by using sets of function pointers given it by the host. These sets of function pointers, known as 'suites', are named via a C string and a version number. They are returned on request from the host as pointers within a C struct.
      </para>

      <para>
	Properties are typed value/name pairs that exist on the various OFX objects and are action argument values to the plug-in's main entry point. They are how a plug-in and host pass individual values back and forth to each other. The property suite, defined inside <filename class="headerfile">ofxProperty.h</filename> is used to do this.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>OFX APIs</title>
      <para>
	An OFX plug-in API is a named set of actions, properties and suites to perform some specific set of tasks. The first such API that has been defined on
	the OFX core is the OFX Image Effect API. The set of actions, properties and suites that constitute the API makes up the major part of this document.
      </para>
      
      <para>
	Various suites and actions have been defined for the OFX image effect API, however many are actually quite generic and could be 
	reused by other APIs. 
	The property suite definitely has to be used by all other APIs, while the memory allocation suite, the parameter
	suite and several others would propably be useful for all other APIs. For example the paramter suite could be re-used to specify user
	visible parameters to the other APIs.
      </para>
      
      <para>
	Several types are common to all OFX APIs, and as such are defined in <filename class="headerfile">ofxCore.h</filename>. Most objects passed back to
	a plug-in are generally specified by blind data handles, for example the <code>OfxPropertySetHandle</code>. This allows for strong typing on functions
	but allows the implementation of the object to be hidden from the plug-in.

	  </listitem>

	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>

	    <emphasis>OfxPlugin</emphasis> - a C struct that a plug-in fills in to describe itself to a host.
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>

      <para>
	Several general assumptions have been made about how hosts and plug-ins communicate, which specific APIs <emphasis>are</emphasis> allowed to break.
	The main is the distinction between...
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <emphasis>descriptors</emphasis> - which hosts and plug-ins use to define the general behaviour of an object, e.g. the object used to specify what bit depths an Image Effect Plug-in is willing to accept,
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <emphasis>instances</emphasis> - which hosts and plug-ins use to control the behaviour of a specific 'live' object.
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	In most APIs descriptors are typically passed from a host to a plug-in during the <link linkEnd="kOfxActionDescribe">kOfxActionDescribe</link> action, whilst all other actions are passed an instance, e.g: the object passed to the <link linkEnd="kOfxActionCreateInstance">kOfxActionCreateInstance</link> action.
      </para>
      
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>The OFX Image Effect API.</title>
      <para>
	The OFX Image Effect Plug-in API is designed for image effect plug-ins for 2D visual effects. This includes such host applications as compositors,
	editors, rotoscoping tools and colour grading sytems.
      </para>
      
      <para>
	At heart the image effect API allows a host to send a plug-in a set of images, state the value of a set of parameters and get a resulting image back. 
	However how it does this is somewhat complicated, as the plug-in and host have to negotiate what kind of images are handled, how they
	can be processed and much more.
      </para>

  <chapter>
    <title>The Generic Core API</title>
    <section>
      This chapter describes how plug-ins are distributed and the core API for loading and identifying image effect plug-ins, and the methods of communications between plug-in and host.
    </section>
    
    &ofxPackaging;


    <section id="Core OFX include files">
      <title>OFX Include Files</title>
      <para>
	The 'C' include files that define an OFX API are all that are needed by a plug-in or host to implement the API. Most include files define a set of independant 'suites' which are used by a plug-in to communicate with a host application. 
      </para>
      
      <para>
	There are two include files that are used with nearly every derived API. These are...
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><filename class="headerfile">ofxCore.h</filename> is used to define the basic communication mechanisms between a host and a plug-in. This includes the way in which a plug-in is defined to a host and how to bootstrap the two way communications. It also has several other basic action and property definitions.
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem><filename class="headerfile">ofxProperty.h</filename> specifies the property suite, which is how a plug-in gets and sets values on various objects in a host application.
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>
    </section>

    <section><title>Identifying and Loading Plug-ins</title>
      <para>Plug-ins must implement two exported functions for a host to identify the plug-ins and to initiate the boot strapping of communication between the two. These functions are...
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><code>int OfxGetNumberOfPlugins(void)</code> - identifies how many plug-ins are implemented in the file,</listitem>
	  <listitem><code>OfxPlugin *OfxGetPlugin(int N)</code> - returns a structure identifying the Nth plug-in in the file.</listitem>

OfxExport int OfxGetNumberOfPlugins(void); </programlisting></blockquote>
	<para>This function returns the number of
	  plug-ins contained in the binary. It is the very first function called
	  by the host after the binary has been loaded.</para>
	
	<para>This function <emphasis>must</emphasis> be exported by the
	  binary that contains OFX plug-ins. The
	  <structname>OfxExport</structname> defined in

    <section id="mainEntryPoint"><title id="OfxPluginEntryPoint">The Plug-in Main Entry Point And Actions</title>
      <para>Actions are how a host communicates with a plug-in. They are in effect generic function calls. Actions are issued via a plug-in's <function>mainEntry</function> function pointer found in its <code>OfxPlugin</code> struct. The function signature for the main entry point is...  </para>
      <blockquote><programlisting>
#include "ofxCore.h"
typedef  OfxStatus (OfxPluginEntryPoint)(const char *action, const void *handle, OfxPropertySetHandle inArgs, OfxPropertySetHandle outArgs); </programlisting></blockquote>
      <para> Where,
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><code>action</code> is a C string indicating the action to be taken,</listitem>
	  <listitem><code>handle</code> is a handle to an object appropriate to that action, cast to <code>void *</code>,</listitem>
	  <listitem><code>inArgs</code> are a set of properties used as arguments to that action,</listitem>
	  <listitem><code>outArgs</code> are a set of properties the plug-in should modify during the action.</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>
      <para>
	The <code>OfxStatus</code> value returned is dependant upon the action being called, however the value <code>kOfxStatReplyDefault</code> is returned if the plug-in does not trap the action.
      </para>
      <para>The exact set of actions passed to a plug-in's entry point are dependent upon the API the plug-in implements. However, there exists a core set of generic actions that most APIs would use.</para>
    </section>
    
    <section><title>Suites</title>
      <para>Suites are how a plug-in communicates back to the host. A suite is simply a set of function pointers in a C struct. The set of suites a host needs to implement is defined by the API being implemented. A suite is fetched from a host via the <code>OfxHost::fetchSuite</code> function. This returns a pointer (cast to <code>void *</code>) to the named and versioned set of functions. By using this suite fetching mechanism, there is no symbolic dependancy from the plug-in to the host, and APIs can be easily expandable without causing backwards compatability issues.
      </para>
      <para>If the host does not implement a requested suite, or the requested version of that suite, then it should return NULL.
      </para>
    </section>
    
    &ofxLoadingSequence;

    
    <section><title>Who Owns The Data?</title>
      <para>
	Objects are passed back and forth across the API, and in general, it is the thing that passes the data that is
	responsible for destroying it. For example the property set handle in the <link linkend="OfxHostStruct"><code>OfxHost struct</code></link>
	is managed by the host.
      </para>

      <para>
	There are a few explicit exceptions to this. For example, when an image effect asks for an image from a host
	it is passed back a property set handle which represents the image. That handle needs to later be disposed of
	by an effect, by an explicit function call back to the host. These few exceptions are documented with the suite
	functions that access the object.
      </para>

      <section id="ArchitectureStrings"><title>Strings</title>
	<para>
	  A special case is made for strings. Strings are considered to be of two types, <emphasis>value</emphasis> strings and 
	  <emphasis>label</emphasis> strings. 
	  A label string is any string used by OFX to name a property or type. A value string is generally a string value of a property.
	</para>

	<para>
	  More specifically, a label string is a string passed across the API as one of the following...
	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem> a property label (ie: the 'char *property' argument in the property suites)</listitem>
	    <listitem> a string argument to a suite function which must be one of a set of predefined set of values
	      eg: <code>paramType</code> argument to <link linkend="OfxParameterSuiteV1_paramDefine">OfxParameterSuiteV1::paramDefine</link>, 
	      but not the <code>name</code> argument)</listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
	</para>
	
	<para>
	  Label strings are considered to be static constant strings. When passed across the API the host/plug-in receiving the string neither needs to duplicate nor free the string, it can simply retain the orginal pointer passed over and use that in future, as it will not change. A host must be aware that when it unloads a plug-in all such pointers will be invalid, and be prepared to cope with such a situation.
	</para>
	
	<para>
	  A value string is a string passed across the API as one of the following...
	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>all value arguments to any of the property suite calls,</listitem>
	    <listitem>any other <code>char *</code> argument to any other function.</listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
	</para>

	<para>
	  Value strings have no assumptions made about them. When one is passed across the
	  API, the thing that passed the string retains ownership of it. The thing getting the 
	  string is not responsible for freeing that string. The scope of the string's validity
	  is until the next OFX API function is called. For example, within a plugin
	</para>

	<blockquote><programlisting>
   // pointer to store the returned value of the host name
   char *returnedHostName;

   // get the host name
   propSuite->propGetString(hostHandle, kOfxPropName, 0, &amp;returnedHostName);

   // now make a copy of that before the next API call, as it may not be valid after it
   char *hostName = strdup(returnedHostName);

   paramSuite->getParamValue(instance, "myParam", &amp;value);
	</programlisting></blockquote>

  <chapter>
    <title>The Image Effect API</title>
    
    <section> <title>Introduction</title>
      <para>
	In general, image effects plug-ins take zero or more input clips and produce an output clip.
	So far so simple, however there are many devils hiding in the details. Several supporting suites 
	are required from the host and the plug-in needs to respond to a range of actions to work correctly. 
	How an effect is intended to be used also complicates the issue, forcing sets of behaviours depending on the context of an effect.
      </para>

      <para>
	Plug-ins that implement the image effect API set the <code>pluginApi</code> member of the <code>OfxPlugin struct</code> 
	returned by the global <code>OfxGetPlugin</code> to be <literal>kOfxImageEffectPluginApi</literal>.
	The current version of the API is 1. This is enough to label the plug-in as an image effect plug-in.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section><title>Image Effect API Header Files</title>
      <para>

      <title>Actions Used by the API</title>
      <para>
	All image effect plug-ins have a main entry point. This is used to trap all the standard actions used to drive the plug-in. They can also have other optional
	entry points that allow the plug-in to create custom user interface widgets. These <emphasis>interact</emphasis> entry points are specified during the 
	two description actions.

    <section><title>Main Objects Used by the API</title>

	  An effect is an object in the OFX Image Effect API that represents an image processing plug-in. It has associated with it
	  a set of properties, a set of image clips and a set of parameters. These component objects of an effect are defined and used by an effect
	  to do whatever processing it needs to. A handle to an image effect (instance or descriptor) is passed into a plug-in's  
	  <link linkend="mainEntryPoint">main entry point</link> <code>handle</code> argument.

	  <para>
	    A effect descriptor does not refer to a 'live' effect, it is a handle which the effect uses to describe itself back to the host. It does
	    this by setting a variety of properties on an associated property handle, and specifying a variety of objects (such as clips and parameters) using
	    functions in the available suites.
	  </para>
	  
	  <para>
	    Once described, a host should cache away the description in some manner so that when an instance is made, it simply looks at the description
	    and creates the necessary objects needed by that instance. This stops the overhead of having every instance be forced to describe itself over
	    the API.

	    A effect instance is an object of type <code>OfxImageEffectHandle</code> passed into an effect's

	    The effect instance represents a 'live' instance of an effect. Because an effect has previously been described, via a effect descriptor, 
	    an instance does not have to respecify the parameters, clips and properties that it needs. These means, that when an instance is passed 
	    to an effect, all the objects previously described will have been created.

  <chapter id="ImageEffectArchitectures"><title>Image Processing Architectures</title>
    <para>
      OFX supports a range of image processing architectures. The simpler ones being special cases of
      the most complex one. Levels of support, in both plug-in and host, are signalled by setting appropriate
      properties in the plugin and host.
    </para>

    <para>
      This chapter describes the most general architecture that OFX can support, with simpler cases just being specialisations
      of the general case.      
    </para>

    <section><title>The Image Plane</title>
      <para>
	At it's most generalised, OFX allows for a complex imaging architecture based around an infinite 2D plane on which we are filling in pixels.
      </para>

      <para>
	Firstly, there is some subsection of this infinite plane that the user wants to be the end result of their work, call this the project extent. 
	The project extent is always rooted, on its bottom left, at the origin of the image plane. The project extent defines the upper right hand corner 
	of the project window. For example a PAL sized project spans (0, 0) to (768, 576) on the image plane. 
      </para>

      <para>
	We define an image effect as something that can fill in a rectangle of pixels in this infinite plane, possibly using images defined at other locations
	on this image plane.
      </para>

    </section>

    <section><title>Regions of Definition</title>
    
      <para>
	An effect has a "Region of Definition" (RoD), this is is the maximum area of the plane that the effect can fill in. 
	for example: a 'read source media' effect would only be able to fill an area as big as it's source media. An effect's 
	RoD may need to be based on the RoD of its inputs, for example: the RoD of a contrast/brightness colour corrector would 
	generally be the RoD of it's input, while the RoD of a rotation effect would be bigger than that of it's input image.
      </para>

      <para>
	The purpose of the <link linkend="kOfxImageEffectActionGetRegionOfDefinition"><code>kOfxImageEffectActionGetRegionOfDefinition</code></link>
	action is for the host to ask an effect what its region of definition is. An effect calculates this by looking at its input clips and the
	values of its current parameters.
      </para>

      <para>
	Hosts are not obliged to render all an effects RoD, as it may have fixed frame sizes, or any number of other issues.
      </para>

      <section><title>Infinite RoDs</title>
	<para>
	  Infinite RoDs are used to indicate an effect can fill pixels in anywhere on the image plane it is asked to. For example
	  a no-input noise generator that generates random colours on a per pixel basis.
	  An infinite RoD is flagged by setting the minimums to be <code>kOfxFlagInfiniteMin</code>
	  and the maxmimums to be <code>kOfxFlagInfiniteMax</code>,
	  for both double and integer rects.
	  Hosts and plug-ins need to be infinite RoD aware. Hosts need to clip such RoDs to an appropriate rectangle, typically the
	  project extent. Plug-ins need to check for infinite RoDs when asking input clips for them and to pass them through unless
	  they explictly clamp them. To indicate an infinite RoD set it as indicated in the following code snippet.
	</para>
	
	<blockquote><programlisting>
	  outputRoD.x1 = kOfxFlagInfiniteMin;
	  outputRoD.y1 = kOfxFlagInfiniteMin;
	  outputRoD.x2 = kOfxFlagInfiniteMax;
	  outputRoD.y2 = kOfxFlagInfiniteMax;
	</programlisting></blockquote>

      </para>
    </section>

    <section><title>Regions Of Interest</title>
      <para>
	An effect will be asked to fill in some region of this infinite plane. The section it is being asked
	to fill in is called the "Region of Interest" (RoI). 
      </para>
	
      <para>
	Before an effect has been asked to process a given RoI, it will be asked to specify the area of each input clip 
	it will need to process that area. For example: a simple colour correction effect only needs as much input as it
	does output, while a blur will need an area that is larger than the specified RoI by a border of the same width
	as the blur radius.
      </para>

      <para>
	The purpose of the <link linkend="kOfxImageEffectActionGetRegionsOfInterest"><code>kOfxImageEffectActionGetRegionsOfInterest</code></link>
	action is for the host to ask an effect what areas it needs from each input clip, to render a specific output region. An effect needs
	to examine its set of parameters and the region it has been asked to render to determine how much of <emphasis>each</emphasis> input
	clip it needs.

    <section><title>Tiled Rendering</title>
      <para>
	Tiling is the ability of an effect to manage images that are less than full frame (or in our current nomenclature, less
	than the full Region of Definition). By tiling the images it renders, a host will render an effect in several passes, 
	say by doing the bottom half, then the top half.
      </para>

      <para>
	Hosts may tile rendering for a variety of reasons. Usually it is in an attempt to reduce memory demands or to distribute
	rendering of an effect to several different CPUs or computers.
      </para>

      <para>
	Effects that in effect only perform per pixel calculations (for example a simple colour gain effect) tile very easily.
	However in the most general case for effects, tiling may be self defeating, as an effect, in order to render a tile,
	may need significantly more from its input clips than the tile in question. For example, an effect that performs an
	2D transform on its input image, may need to sample all that image even when rendering a very small tile on output, as 
	the input image may have been scaled down so that it only covers a few pixels on output.
      </para>

      <para>
	PICTURES
      </para>
    </section>

    <section><title>Tree Based Architectures</title>
      <para>
	The most general compositing hosts allow images to be of any size at any location on our image plane. They also plumb the output
	of effects into other effects, to create effect trees.
	When evaluating this tree of effects, a general host will want to render the minimum number of pixels it needs to fill in the
	final desired image. Typically the top level of this compositing tree is being rendered at a certain project size, for example 
	PAL SD, 2K film and so on. This is where the RoD/RoI calls come in handy.
      </para>

      <para>
	The host asks the top effect how much picture information it can produce, which in turn asks
	effects below it their RoDs and so on until leaf effects are reached, which report back up the tree 
	until the top effect calculates its RoD and reports back to the host. The host typically clips that
	RoD to its project size.
      </para>

      <para>
	Having determined in this way the window it wants rendered at the top effect, the host asks the top
	node the regions of interest on each of it's inputs. This again propagates down the effect tree
	until leaf nodes are encountered. These regions of interest are cached at effect for later use.
      </para>

      <para>
	At this point the host can start rendering, from the bottom of the tree upwards, by asking each
	effect to fill in the region of interest that was previously specified in the RoI walk. These regions
	are then passed to the next level up to render and so on.
      </para>

      <para>
	Another complication is tiling. If a host tiles, it will need to walk the tree and perform the RoI calculation 
	for each tile that it renders.
      </para>

      <para>
	The details may differ on specific hosts, but this is more or less the most generic way compositing hosts
	currently work.

	PICTURES
      </para>
    </section>

    <section><title>Simpler Architectures</title>
      <para>
	The above architecture is quite complex, as the inputs supplied can lie anywhere on the image plane,
	as can the output, and they can be subsections of the 'complete' image. Not all hosts work in this way,
	generally it is only the more advance compositing systems working on large resolution images. 
      </para>
      
      <para>
	Some other systems allow for images to be anywhere on the image plane, but always pass around full RoD images, 
	never tiles.
      </para>

      <para>
	The simplest systems, don't have any of of the above complexity. The RoDs, RoIs, images and project sizes in such 
	systems are exactly the same, always. Often these are editting, as opposed to compositing, systems.
      </para>

      <para>
	Similarly, some plugin effects cannot handle sub RoD images, or even images not rooted at the origin.
      </para>

      <para>
	The OFX architecture is meant to support all of them. Assuming a plugin supports the most general architecture,
	it will trivially run on hosts with simpler architectures. However, if a plugin does not support tiled, or 
	arbitarily positioned images, they may not run cleanly on hosts that expect them to do so.
      </para>

      <para>
	To this end, two properties are provided that flag the capabilities of a plugin or host...
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><link linkend="kOfxImageEffectPropSupportsMultiResolution"><code>kOfxImageEffectPropSupportsMultiResolution</code></link> - which indicates support for images of differing sizes not centred on the origin,</listitem>
	  <listitem><link linkend="kOfxImageEffectPropSupportsTiles"><code>kOfxImageEffectPropSupportsTiles</code></link>- which indicates support for images that contain less than full frame pixel data</listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
      </para>
      
      <para>
	A plug-in should flag these appropriately, so that hosts know how to deal with the effect. A host can either choose to refuse
	to load a plugin, or, preferentially, pad images with an appropriate amount of black/transparent pixels to enable them to work.
      </para>

      <para>
	The <code>kOfxImageEffectActionGetRegionsOfInterest</code> is redundant for plugins that do not support tiled rendering, 
	as the plugin is asking that it be given the full Region of Definition of all its inputs. A host may have 
	difficulty doing this (for example with an input that is attached to an effect that can create infinite images
	such as a random noise generator), if so, it should clamp images to some a size in some manner.
      </para>

      <para>
	The RoD/RoI actions are potentially redundant on simpler hosts. For example fixed frame size hosts. If a host has no need to
	call these actions, it simply should not.

  <chapter id="ImageEffectContexts"><title>Image Effect Contexts</title>
    <para>
      How an image effect is used by an end user affects how it should interact with a host application. 
      For example an effect that is to be used as a transition between two clips works differently to an effect that 
      is a simple filter. One must have two inputs and know how much to mix between the two input clips, the other has 
      fewer constraints on it. Within OFX we have standardised several different uses and have called them <emphasis>contexts</emphasis>.

      More specifically, a context mandates certain behaviours from an effect when it is described or instantiated in that 
      context. The major issue is the number of input clips it takes, and how it can interact with those input clips.

      All OFX contexts have a single output clip and zero or more input clips. The current contexts defined in OFX

    <para>
      A host or plug-in need not support all contexts. For example a host that does not have any paint facility within it
      should not need to support the paint context, or a simple blur effect need not support the retimer context.
    </para>

    <para>
      An effect may say that it can be used in more than one context, for example a blur effect that acts as a filter, with a single input to blur,
      and a general effect, with an input to blur and an optional input to act as a mask to attenuate the blur. In such cases a host should choose
      the most appropriate context for the way that host's architecture. With our blur example, a tree based compositing host should 
      simply ignore the filter context and always use it in the general context. 
    </para>

    <para>
      Plugins and hosts inform each other what contexts they work in via the multidimensional
      <link linkend="kOfxImageEffectPropSupportedContexts"><code>kOfxImageEffectPropSupportedContexts</code></link> property. 
      It must be set to at least one of the following values...
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><code>kOfxImageEffectContextGenerator</code></listitem>
	<listitem><code>kOfxImageEffectContextFilter</code></listitem>
	<listitem><code>kOfxImageEffectContextTransition</code></listitem>
	<listitem><code>kOfxImageEffectContextPaint</code></listitem>
	<listitem><code>kOfxImageEffectContextGeneral</code></listitem>
	<listitem><code>kOfxImageEffectContextRetimer</code></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    
    <para>
      A host indicates which contexts it supports by setting the <code>kOfxImageEffectPropSupportedContexts</code> property in
      the global host descriptor. A plugin indicates which contexts it supports by setting this on the effect descriptor passed to
      the <link linkend="kOfxActionDescribe"><code>kOfxActionDescribe</code></link> action.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      Because a plugin can work in different ways, it needs the ability to describe itself to the host in different ways. This
      is the purpose of the <link linkend="kOfxImageEffectActionDescribeInContext"><code>kOfxImageEffectActionDescribeInContext</code></link>
      action. This action is called once for each context that the effect supports, and the effect gets to describe the input clips and
      parameters appropriate to that context. This means that an effect can have different sets of parameters and clips in different contexts,
      though it will most likely have a core set of parameters that it uses in all contexts. From our blur example, both the filter and general
      contexts would have a 'blur radius' parameter, but the general context might have an 'invert matte' parameter.
    </para>

    <para>
      During the <code>kOfxImageEffectActionDescribeInContext</code> action, an effect must describe all clips and parameters that it 
      intends to use. This includes the mandated clips and parameters for that context.
    </para>

    <para>
      A plugin instance is created in a specific contex which will not changed over the lifetime of that instance. The context
      can be retrieved from the instance via the <link linkend="kOfxImageEffectPropContext"><code>kOfxImageEffectPropContext</code></link> 
      property on the instance handle.

      <para>
	A host is responsible for setting the initial preferences of the output clip, it must do this in a manner that is 
	transparent to the plugin. So the pixel depths, components, fielding, frame rate and pixel aspect ratio are under the
	control of the host. How it arrives at these is a matter for the host, but as a plugin specifies what components it 
	can produce on output, as well as the pixel depths it supports, the host must choose one of these.

    <section id="ImageEffectContextMandatedParameters"><title>Parameters Mandated In A Context</title>
      <para>
	The retimer and transition context both mandate a parameter be declared, the double params 'SourceTime' and 'Transition'. 
	The purpose of these parameters is for the host to communicate with the plug-in, they are <emphasis>not</emphasis> meant
	to be treated as normal parameters, exposed on the user plug-in's user interface.
      </para>

      <para>
	For example, the purpose of a transition effect is to dissolve in some interesting way between two separate clips,
	under control of the host application. Typically this is done on systems that edit. The mandated 'Transition' double
	pseudo-parameter is not a normal one exposed on the plug-in UI, rather it is the way the host indicates how far through 
	the transition the effect is. For example, think about two clips on a time line based editor with a transition between them,
	the host would set the value value of the 'Transition' parameter implicitly by how far the frame being rendered is from 
	the start of the transition, something along the lines of...
      </para>
      
      <blockquote><programlisting>
	Transition = (currrentFrame - startOfTransition)/lengthOfTransition;</programlisting></blockquote>
      
      
      <para>
	This means that the host is completely responsible for any user interface for that parameter, either implicit
	(as in the above editing example) or explicit (with a curve). 
      </para>
      
      <para>
	Similarly with the 'SourceTime' double parameter in the retimer context. It is up to the host to provide a
	UI for this, either implicitly (say by stretching a clip's length on the time line) or via an explicit curve.
	Note that the host is not limitted to using a UI that exposes the 'SourceTime' as a curve, alternately it 
	could present a 'speed' parameter, and integrate that to derive a value for 'SourceTime'.

  <chapter><title>Thread and Recursion Safety</title>
    <para>
      Hosts are generally multi-threaded, those with a GUI will most likely have an interactive 
      thread and a rendering thread, while any host running on a multi-CPU machine may have a render 
      thread per CPU. Host may batch effects off to a render farm, where the same effect has separate
      frames rendered on completely different machines. OFX needs to address all these situations.
    </para>

    <para>
      Threads in the host application can be broken into two categories...
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><emphasis>main theaads</emphasis>, where any action may be called</listitem>
	<listitem><emphasis>render threads</emphasis> where only a subset of actions may be called.</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>
      For a given effect instance, there can be only one main thread and zero or more render threads. 
      An instance must be able to handle simultaneous actions called on the main and render threads. 
      A plugin can control the number of simultaneous render threads via the 
      <link linkend="kOfxImageEffectPluginRenderThreadSafety"><code>kOfxImageEffectPluginRenderThreadSafety</code></link> 
      effect descriptor property.

    </para>

    <para>
      If a plugin cannot support this multi-threading behaviour, it will need to perform explicit locking itself,
      using the locking mechanisms in the suites defined in ofxMultiThread.h
    </para>

    <para>
      This will also mean that the host may need to perform locking on the various function calls over the API.
      For example, a main and render thread may both simultaneously attempt to access a parameter from a single effect
      instance. The locking should...
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>block write/read access</listitem>
	<listitem>not block on read/read access</listitem>
	<listitem>be fine grained at the level of individual function calls,</listitem>
	<listitem>be transparent to the plugin, so it will block until the call succeeds.</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>
      For example, a render thread will only cause a parameter to lock out writes only for the duration of 
      the call that reads the parameter, not for the duration of the whole render action. This will allow a
      main thread to continue writing to the parameter during a render. This is especially important if you
      have a custom interactive GUI that you want to keep working during a render call.
    </para>

    <para>
      Note that a main thread should generally issue an abort to any linked render thread when a
      parameter or other value affecting the effect (eg: time) has been changed by the user. A re-render
      should then be issued so that a correct frame is created.
    </para>

    <para>
      How an effect handles simulanteous calls to render is dealt with in \ref ImageEffectsMultiThreadingRendering.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      Many hosts get around the problem of sharing a single instance in a UI thread and a render thread by
      having two instances, one for the user to interact with and a render only one that shadows the
      UI instance. 
    </para>

      </para>

      <section id="CanonicalCoordinates"><title>Canonical Coordinates</title>
	<para>
	  The idealised image plane is always in a coordinate system of square unscaled pixels.
	  For example a PAL D1 frame occupies (0,0) to (768,576). We call this the <emphasis>Canonical Coordinate System</emphasis>.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Many operations take place in canonical coordinates, parameter values are expressed in them while the and RoD and RoI actions
	  report their values back in them.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The Canonical coordinate system is always referenced by double floating point values, generally via a <code>OfxRectD</code> structure.
	</para>
      </section>

      <section id="PixelCoordinates"><title>Pixel Coordinates</title>
	<para>
	  'Real' images, where we have to deal with addressable pixels in memory, 
	  are in a coordinate system of non-square proxy scaled integer values. 
	  So a PAL D1 image, being renderred as a half resolution proxy would be (0,0) to (360, 288), 
	  which takes into account both the pixel aspect ratio of 1.067 and a scale factor of 0.5f. 
	  We call this the <emphasis>Pixel Coordinate System</emphasis>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The Pixel coordinate system is always referenced by integer values, generally via a OfxRectI structure.
	  It is used when refering to operations on actual pixels, and so is how the bounds of images are described
	  and the render window passed to the render action.
	</para>
      </section>

      <section id="MappingCoordinates"><title>Mapping Between The Spatial Coordinate Systems</title>

	  To map between the two the pixel aspect ratio and the render scale need to be known, and it is a simple case of multiplication and rounding. More specifically,  given...

      <section id="NormalisedCoordinateSystem"><title>The Normalized Coordinate System</title>
  <para>Note, normalised parameters and the normalised coordinate system are being deprecated in favour of <link linkend='ParameterPropertiesDoubleTypesSpatial'>spatial parameters</link> which can handle the project rescaling without the problems of converting to/from normalised coordinates.</para>
	<para>
	  On most editing an compositing systems projects can be moved on resolutions, for example a
	  project may be set up at high definition then have several versions rendered out at different sizes, say a
	  PAL SD version, an NTSC SD version and an HD 720p version.
	</para>

	<para>
	  This causes problems with parameters that describe spatial coordinates. If they are expressed as absolute 
	  positions, the values will be incorrect as the project is moved from resolution to resolution.
	  For example, a circle drawn at (384,288) in PAL SD canonical coordinates will be in the centre of the 
	  output. Re-render that at 2K film, it will be in  the bottom left hand corner, which is probably not the correct
	  spot.
	</para>
	
	<para>
	  To get around this, OFX allows parameters to be flagged as <emphasis>normalised</emphasis>, which is a resolution
	  independant method of representing spatial coordinates. In this coordinate system, a point expressed as (0.5, 0.5)
	  will appear in the centre of the screen, always.
	</para>
      
	<para>
	  To transform between normalised and canonical coordinates a simple linear equation is required. What that is
	  requires a certain degree of explanation. It involves three two dimensional values...
	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem><emphasis>the project extent</emphasis> the resolution of the project, eg: PAL SD</listitem>
	    <listitem><emphasis>the project size</emphasis> how much of that is used by imagery, eg: the letter box area in a 16:9 PAL SD project</listitem>
	    <listitem><emphasis>the project offset</emphasis> the bottom left corner of the extent being used, eg: the BL corner of a 16:9 PAL SD project</listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
	</para>

	<para>
	  As described above, the project extent is the section of the image plane that is coverred
	  by an image that is the desired output of the project, so for a PAL SD project you get an extent of 0,0 to 768,576. 
	  As the project is always rooted at the origin, so the extent is actually a size.
	</para>
	
	<para>
	  Project sizes and offsets are a bit less obvious. Consider a project that is going to be output as PAL D1 imagery,
	  the extent will be 0,0 to 768,576. However our example is a letter box 16:9 project, which leaves a strip of black at
	  bottom and top. The size of the letter box is 768 by 432, while the bottom left of the letter box is offset from the
	  origin by 0,77. The ASCII art below shows the details.....

	  To flag to the host that a parameter as normalised, we use the

	  that are so flagged have values set and retrieved by an effect in normalized coordinates. However a host
	  can choose to represent them to the user in whatever space it chooses. The values that this property can

	  </itemizedlist>
	</para>

	<para> 
	  For example, we have an effect that draws a circle. It has two parameters a 1D double radius parametere and a 2D double position parameter. 
	  It would flag the radius to be <code>kOfxParamDoubleTypeNormalisedX</code>, fetch the value and scale that by the project size before we render the circle. The host should present such normalised parameters to the user in a 'sensible' range. So for a PAL project, it would be from 0..768, where the plug-in sees 0..1. 
	</para>
	<para>
	  The position can be handled by the <code>kOfxParamDoubleTypeNormalisedXYAbsolute</code> case. In which case the plugin must scale the parameter's value by the project size and add in the project offset. This will allow the positional parameter to be moved between projects transparently.

    <section><title>Temporal Coordinates</title>
      <para>
	Within OFX Image Effects, there is only one temporal coordinate system, this is in output frames 
	referenced to the start of the effect (so the first affected frame = 0). All times within the API are in that coordinate system.
      </para>

      <para>
	All clip instances have a property that indicates the frames for which they can generate image data. 
	This is <link linkend="kOfxImageEffectPropFrameRange"><code>kOfxImageEffectPropFrameRange</code></link>, a 2D 
	double property, with the first dimension being the first, and 
	the second being last the time at which the clip will generate data.
      </para>

      <para>
	Consider the example below, it is showing an effect of 10 frames duration applied to a clip lasting 20 frames.
	The first frame of the effect is infact the 5th frame of the clip. Both the input and output have the same frame rate.
      </para>

      <blockquote><programlisting>
Effect               0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9

      </programlisting></blockquote>

      <para>
	In this example, if the effect asks for the source image at time '4', the host will actually return the 9th image of that clip. 
	When queried the output and source clip instances would report the following...
      </para>
      <blockquote><programlisting>
           range[0]     range[1]    FPS

  <chapter><title>Images and Clips</title>

    <section id="ImageEffectsImagesAndClipsIntro"><title>What Is An Image?</title>
      <para>
	Image Effects process images (funny that), this chapeter describes images and clips of images, 
	how they behave and how to deal with them. 
      </para>

      <para>
	Firstly some definitions...
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>an <emphasis>image</emphasis> is a rectangular array of addressable pixels,</listitem>
	  <listitem>a <emphasis>clip</emphasis> is a contiguous sequence of images that vary over time.</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>

      <para>
	Images and clips contain pixels, these pixels can currently be of the following types...
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>a colour pixel with red, green, blue, alpha components</listitem>
	  <listitem>a colour pixel with red, green and blue components</listitem>
	  <listitem>single component 'alpha' images</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>

      <para>
	The components of the pixels can be of the following types...
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>8 bit unsigned byte, with the nominal black and white points at 0 and 255 respectively,</listitem>
	  <listitem>16 bit unsigned short, with the nominal black and white points at 0 and 65535 respectively,</listitem>
	  <listitem>32 bit float, with the nominal black and white points at 0.0f and 1.0f respectively, component values are 
	    <emphasis>not</emphasis> clipped to 0.0f and 1.0f.</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>

      <para>
	Components are packed per pixel in the following manner...
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>RGBA pixels as R, G, B, A</listitem>
	  <listitem>RGB pixels as R, G, B</listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
      </para>

      <para>
	There are several structs for pixel types in ofxCore.h that can be used for raw pixels in OFX.
      </para>

      <para>
	Images are always left to right, bottom to top, with the pixel data pointer being at the bottom left of the image.
	The pixels in a scan line are contiguously packed.
      </para>

      <para>
	Scanlines need <emphasis>not</emphasis> be contiguously packed. The number of <emphasis>bytes</emphasis> between between a pixel in 
	the same column, but separated by a scan line is known as the  <emphasis>rowbytes</emphasis> of an image. Rowbytes can be negative, 
	allowing for compositing systems with a native top to bottom scanline order to trivially support bottom to top images.
      </para>

      <para>
	Clips and images also have a <emphasis>pixel aspect ratio</emphasis>, this is how much an actual addressable pixel
	must be stretched by in X to be square. For example PAL SD images have a pixel aspect ratio of 1.06666. 
      </para>

      <para>
	Images are rectangular, whose integral bounds are in Pixel coordinates, with the image being X1 &lt;= X &lt; X2 and Y1 &lt;= Y &lt; Y2,
	ie: exclusive on the top and right. The bounds represent the amount of data present in the image, which may be larger, 
	smaller or equal to the Region of Definition of the image, depending on the architecture supported by the plugin.
	The <link linkend="kOfxImagePropBounds"><code>kOfxImagePropBounds</code></link> property on an image holds this information. 
      </para>
      
      <para>
	An image also contains it's RoD in image coordinates, 
	in the <link linkend="kOfxImagePropRegionOfDefinition"><code>kOfxImagePropRegionOfDefinition</code></link> property. The RoD is the maximum area that an image may have pixels in, t
	he bounds are the actual addressable pixels present in an image. This allows for tiled rendering an so on.
      </para>
	
      <para>
	Clips have a frame rate, which is the number of frames per second they are to be displayed at.
	Some clips may be continously samplable (for example, if they are connected to animating geometry 
	that can be rendered at arbitrary times), if this is so, the frame rate for these clips is set to 0.
      </para>

      <para>
	Images may be composed of full frames, two fields or a single field, depending on its source and how the effect
	requests the image be processed. Clips are either full frame sequences or fielded sequences.
      </para>

      <para>
	Images and clips also have a premultiplication state, this represents how the alpha component and the
	RGB/YUV components may have interacted.

    <section id="ImageEffectsMemoryAllocation"><title>Allocating Your Own Images</title>
      <para>
	Under OFX, the  images you fetch from the host have already had their memory allocated. 
	If a plug-in needs to define its owns temporary images buffers during processing, or to cache 
	images between actions, then the plug-in should use the image memory allocation routines
	declared in OfxImageEffectSuiteV1. The reason for this is that many host have special 
	purpose memory pools they manage to optimise memory usage as images can chew up memory 
	very rapidly (eg: a 2K RGBA floating point film plate is 48 MBytes).
      </para>
      
      <para>
	For general purpose (as in less than a megabyte) memory allocation, you should use the memory suite in ofxMemory.h
      </para>	

      <para>
	OFX provides four functions to deal with image memory. These are,
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><link linkend="OfxImageEffectSuiteV1_imageMemoryAlloc"><code>OfxImageEffectSuiteV1::imageMemoryAlloc</code></link></listitem>
	  <listitem><link linkend="OfxImageEffectSuiteV1_imageMemoryFree"><code>OfxImageEffectSuiteV1::imageMemoryFree</code></link></listitem>

	  <listitem><link linkend="OfxImageEffectSuiteV1_imageMemoryUnlock"><code>OfxImageEffectSuiteV1::imageMemoryUnlock</code></link></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>

      <para>
	A host needs to be able defragment its image memory pool, potentially moving the contents
	of the memory you have allocated to another address, even saving it to disk under its own
	virtual memory caching scheme. Because of this when you request a block of memory, you are 
	actually returned a handle to the memory, not the memory itself. To use the memory you must
	first lock the memory via the imageMemoryLock call, which will then return a pointer to the 
	locked block of memory.
      </para>

      <para>
	During an single action, there is generally no need to lock/unlock any temporary buffers you 
	may have allocated via this mechanism. However image memory that is cached between actions 
	should always be unlocked while it is not actually being used. This allows a host to do what 
	it needs to do to optimise memory usage.
      </para>

      <para>
	Note that locks and unlocks nest. This implies that there is a lock count kept on 
	the memory handle, also not that this lock count cannot be negative. So unlocking a completely unlocked handle has no effect.
      </para>

      <para>
      An example is below....
      </para>
      <blockquote><programlisting>
  // get a memory handle
  OfxImageMemoryHandle memHandle;
  gEffectSuite->imageMemoryAlloc(0, imageSize, &amp;memHandle);

  // lock the handle and get a pointer

  gEffectSuite->imageMemoryLock(memHandle, &amp;memPtr);
  
  ... // do stuff with our pointer

  // now unlock it
  gEffectSuite->imageMemoryUnlock(memHandle);

  
  // lock it again, note that this may give a completely different address to the last lock
  gEffectSuite->imageMemoryLock(memHandle, &amp;memPtr);
  
  ... // do more stuff

  // unlock it again
  gEffectSuite->imageMemoryUnlock(memHandle);

  // delete it all

    <section><title>Rendering and The Get Region Actions</title>

      <para>
	Many hosts attempt to minimise the areas that they render by using regions of interest and regions of

	per frame rendered, is something along the lines of....

	<listitem>render the effect against it's clipped render window.</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>
	A host can ask an effect to render an arbitrary window of pixels, generally these should be clipped 
	to an effect's region of definition, however, depending on the host, they may not be. The actual region 
	to render is indicated by the <link linkend="kOfxImageEffectPropRenderWindow"><code>kOfxImageEffectPropRenderWindow</code></link>
	render action argument. If an effect is asked to render outside of its region of definition, it should fill those pixels
	in with black transparent pixels.

      <para>
	Note thate <link linkend="OfxImageEffectSuiteV1_clipGetImage"><code>OfxImageEffectSuiteV1::clipGetImage</code></link> function 
	takes an optional <emphasis>region</emphasis> parameter. This is a region, in Canonical coordinates, that the effect would like on 
	that input clip.
	If not used in a render action, then the image returned should be based on the previous get region of interest action. If used,
	then the image returned will be based on this (usually be clipped to the input's region of definition). Generally a plugin should
	not use the <emphasis>region</emphasis> parameter in the render action, but should leave it to the 'default' region.

    <section id="ImageEffectsMultiThreadingRendering"><title>Multi-threaded Rendering</title>

	<para>
	  When rendering on computers that have more that once CPU (or this new-fangled hyperthreading), hosts and
	  effects will want to take advantage of all that extra CPU goodness to speed up rendering. This means 
	  multi-threading of the render function in some way. 
	</para>
	
	<para>
	  If the plugin has set <link linkend="kOfxImageEffectPluginRenderThreadSafety"><code>kOfxImageEffectPluginRenderThreadSafety</code></link>
	  to <code>kOfxImageEffectRenderFullySafe</code>, the host may choose to render a
	  single frame across multiple CPUs by having each CPU render a different window. However, the plugin may wish to remain in charge of 
	  multithreading a single frame. The plugin set property 
	  <link linkend="kOfxImageEffectPluginPropHostFrameThreading"><code>kOfxImageEffectPluginPropHostFrameThreading</code></link> 
	  informs the host as to whether the host should perform SMP on the effect. It can be set to either...
	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>1, in which case the host will attempt to multithread an effect instance by calling it's render function called simultaneously, each call will be with a different renderWindow, but be at the same frame</listitem>

	  </itemizedlist>

	<para>
	  A host may have a render farm of computers. Depending exactly how the host works with it's render farm, it may have multiple

	</para>
      </section>
      
      <section id="ImageEffectsSequentialRendering"><title>Rendering Sequential Effects</title>
      <para>
	  Some plugins need the output of the previous frame to render the next, typically they cache some information about the last render and use that 
    somehow on the next frame. Some temporally averaging degraining algorithms work that way. Such effects cannot render correctly unless they are 
    strictly rendered in order, from first to last frame, on a single instance.
      </para>
    <para>
Other plugins are able to render correctly when called in an arbitrary frame order, but render much more efficiently if rendered in order. For example a particle system which mantains the state of the particle system in an instance would simply increment the simulation by a frame if rendering in-order, but would need to restart the particle system from scratch if the frame jumped backwards.
</para>
    <para>
    Most plug-ins do not have any sequential dependence. For example, a simple gain operation has no dependence on the previous frame.
    </para>
    <para>
    Similarly, host applications, due to their architectures, may or may not be able to guarantee that a plugin can be rendered strictly in-order. Node based applications 
    typically have much more difficulty in guaranteeing such behaviour. 
    </para>

    <para> To indicate whether a plugin needs to be rendered in a strictly sequential order, and to indicate whether a host supports such behaviour we have a property, 
   <link linkend="kOfxImageEffectInstancePropSequentialRender"><code>kOfxImageEffectInstancePropSequentialRender</code></link>. For plug-ins this can be one of three values...
	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>0, in which case the host can render an instance over arbitrary frame ranges on an arbitrary number of computers without any problem (default),</listitem>
	    <listitem>1, in which case the host must render an instance on a single computer over it's entire frame range, from first to last.</listitem>
	    <listitem>2, in which case the effect is more efficiently rendered in frame order, but can compute the correct result irregardless of render order.</listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
	</para>	

  <para> For hosts, this property takes three values...
	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>0, which indicates thet the host can never guarantee sequential rendering,</listitem>
	    <listitem>1, which indicates thet the host can guarantee sequential rendering for plugins that request it,</listitem>
	    <listitem>2, which indicates thet the host can sometimes perform sequential rendering.</listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
	</para>
	
  <para> When rendering, a host will set the in args property on <link linkend="kOfxImageEffectPropSequentialRenderStatus"><code>kOfxImageEffectPropSequentialRenderStatus</code></link> to indicate whether the host is currently supporting sequential renders. This will be passed to the following actions,
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><link linkend="kOfxImageEffectActionBeginSequenceRender">the begin sequence render action</link></listitem>
      <listitem><link linkend="kOfxImageEffectActionRender">the sequence render action</link></listitem>

  </para>

	<para>
	  Hosts may still render sequential effects with random frame access in interactive sessions, for example when the user 
	  scrubs the current frame on the timeline and the host asks an effect to render a preview frame. In such cases, 
	  the plugin can detect that the instance is being interactively manipulated via the <link linkend="kOfxImageEffectPropInteractiveRenderStatus"><code>kOfxImageEffectPropInteractiveRenderStatus</code></link> property and hack an approximation together for UI purposes.
	  If eventually rendering the sequence, the host <emphasis>must</emphasis> ignore all frames rendered out of order and not cache them

	Before we start, some nomenclature. The Y-Axis is considerred to be up, so in a fielded image,

      </para>

      <para>
	Clips and images from those clips are flagged as to whether they are fielded or not, and if so what is the

      <para>
	The reason for this is an optimisation. Imagine a text generator with no animation being asked to render into a

	effect to render both fields in one hit and save on the overhead required to do the rendering in two passes.

      <para>
	The render action's argument property

      There are two things in an image effect can have their own interact, these are...
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>as on overlay on the image being currently viewed in any image viewer, set via the effect descriptor's <link linkend="kOfxImageEffectPluginPropOverlayInteractV1"><code>kOfxImageEffectPluginPropOverlayInteractV1</code></link> property</listitem>
	<listitem>as a replacement for any parameter's standard GUI object, set this via the parameter descriptor's <link linkend="kOfxParamPropInteractV1"><code>kOfxParamPropInteractV1</code></link> property</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>
      Hosts might not be able to support interacts, to indicate this, two properties exist on the host descriptor which 
      an effect should examine at description time so as to determine its own behaviour. These are...
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><link linkend="kOfxImageEffectPropSupportsOverlays"><code>kOfxImageEffectPropSupportsOverlays</code></link></listitem>
	<listitem><link linkend="kOfxParamHostPropSupportsCustomInteract"><code>kOfxParamHostPropSupportsCustomInteract</code></link></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>
      Interacts are separate objects to the effect they are associated with,
      they have their own descriptor and instance handles
      passed into their separate <link linkend="mainEntryPoint"><code>main entry point</code></link>.
    </para>

    <para>
      An interact instance cannot exist without a plugin instance, an interact's instance, once created, is bound to a single instance of a plugin until the interact instance is destroyed.
    </para>
      
    <para>
      All interacts of the same type share openGL display lists, even if they are in different openGL contexts.
    </para>

    <para>
      All interacts of the same type will have the same pixel types (this is a side effect of the last point), this will 
      always be double buffered with at least RGB components. Alpha and the exact bit depth is left to the implementation.
    </para>

    <para>
      So for example, all image effect overlays share the same display lists and have the same pixel depth, 
      and all custom parameter GUIs share the same display list and have the same pixel depth, but overlays 
      and custom parameter GUIs do not necassarily share the same display list/pixel depths.
    </para>

    <para>
      An interact instance may be used in more than one view. Consider an image effect overlay interact in a
      host that supports multiple viewers to an effect instance. The same interact instance will be used in all 
      views, the relevant properties controlling the view being changed before any action is passed to the interact.
      In this example, the draw action would be called once for each view open on the instance, with the projection, 
      viewport and pixel scale being set appropriately for the view before each action.  
    </para>

    <section id="ImageEffectOverlays"><title>Overlay Interacts</title>
      <para>
	Hosts will generally display images (both input and output) in user their interfaces.
	A plugin can put an interact in this display by setting the effect descriptor <link linkend="kOfxImageEffectPluginPropOverlayInteractV1"><code>kOfxImageEffectPluginPropOverlayInteractV1</code></link> 
	property to point to a main entry.
      </para>

      <para>
	The viewport for such interacts will depend completely on the host.
      </para>
 
      <para>
	The GL_PROJECTION matrix will be set up so that it maps openGL coordinates to canonical image coordinates.
      </para>

      <para>
	The GL_MODELVIEW matrix will be the identity matrix.
      </para>
      <para>
	An overlay's interact draw action should assume that it is sharing the openGL context and viewport
	with other objects that belong to the host. It should not blank the background and it
	should never swap buffers, that is for the host to do.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="ParametersInteracts"><title>Parameter Interacts</title>
      <para>
	All parameters, except for custom parameters, have some default interface that the host creates for them. 
	Be it a numeric slider, colour swatch etc... Effects can override the default interface 
	(or set an interface for a custom parameter) by setting the <link linkend="kOfxParamPropInteractV1"><code>kOfxParamPropInteractV1</code></link>.
	This will completely replace the parameters default user interface in the 'paged' and 'hierarchical'
	interfaces, but it will not replace the parameter's interface in any animation sheet.
      </para>

      <para>
	Properties affecting custom interacts for parameters are...
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><link linkend="kOfxParamPropInteractSizeAspect"><code>kOfxParamPropInteractSizeAspect</code></link></listitem>

	  <listitem><link linkend="kOfxParamPropInteractPreferedSize"><code>kOfxParamPropInteractPreferedSize</code></link></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>

      <para>
	The viewport for such interacts will be dependant upon the various properties above, and possibly a per
	host override in any XML resource file.
      </para>
 
      <para>
	The GL_PROJECTION matrix will be an orthographic 2D view with -0.5,-0.5 at the bottom left and viewport width-0.5,
	viewport height-0.5 at the top right. 
      </para>

      <para>
	The GL_MODELVIEW matrix will be the identity matrix.
      </para>

      <para>
	The bit depth will be double buffered 24 bit RGB.
      </para>
      
      <para>
	A parameter's interact draw function will have full responsibility for drawing the interact, including 
	clearing the background and swapping buffers.

      <para> 
	An interact cannot be described until an effect has been described.
      </para>

      <para>
	An interact instance must always be associated with an effect instance. So it gets created after an effect and destroyed before one.

      <para>
	An interact instance should be issued a gain focus action before any key or pen actions are issued, and a lose focus action when
	it goes.

    <para>The files <filename class="headerfile">ofxCore.h</filename> and <filename class="headerfile">ofxProperty.h</filename> contain the basic definitions for the property suite. </para>
    <para>The property suite is the most basic and important suite in OFX, it is used to get and set the values of various objects defined by other suites. 
    </para>
    <para>A property is a named value of a specific data type, such values can be multi-dimensional, but is typically of one dimension. The name 
      is a 'C' string literal, typically #defined in one of the various OFX header files. For example, the property labeled by the string literal <constant>"OfxPropName"</constant> is a 'C' string which holds the name of some object.
    </para>
    <para>Properties are not accessed in isolation, but are grouped and accessed through a property set handle. The number and types of properties on a specific property set handle are currently strictly defined by the API that the properties are being used for. There is no scope to add new properties.
    </para>
    <para>There is a naming convention for property labels and the macros #defined to them. The scheme is,

        <listitem>generic properties names start with <constant>"OfxProp"</constant> + name of the property, e.g. "OfxPropTime".</listitem>
        <listitem>properties pertaining to a specific object with <constant>"Ofx"</constant> + object name + <constant>"Prop"</constant> + name of the property, e.g. "OfxParamPropAnimates".</listitem>
        <listitem>the C preprocessor #define used to define the string literal is the same as the string literal, but with
