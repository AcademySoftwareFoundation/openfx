# OpenFX C++ Bindings

This is a set of C++ bindings for parts of OpenFX. It consists of a
set of prerelease-quality (for now) C++17 header files. They primarily
simplify type-safe access to properties, params, images and suites. It
includes a simple logging facility and a set of standard exceptions.

The goal is to include a version of this in the next OpenFX release.
