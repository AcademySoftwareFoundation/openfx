## Why a Standard?
VFX plug-in vendors were frustrated for years because host application vendors created proprietary plug-in interfaces. As a result, each plug-in vendor had to port their plug-ins to all the different hosts and hosts couldn't use each other's plug-ins, limiting the selection of effects available to artists. The need for a standard interface was clear, so Bruno Nicoletti of The Foundry led the effort to develop a standard. That standard is OFX.

OFX is a win for artists because there is no waiting for plug-in vendors to port their cool effects to your application. Once a host compositing or editing application adopts OFX, all OFX plug-ins on the market instantly become available on that host.

And OFX is a win for plug-in vendors because they can concentrate on what they do best: making cool effects

## OFX Terminology
### Host
A video compositing or editing application, such as The Foundry Nuke, Assimilate Scratch, Sony Vegas, or FilmLight Baselight
### Plug-in
Video software, such as GenArts Sapphire or RE:Vison Effects which adds a wider variety of effects to a host application.
### Open Effects
A standardized software interface between VFX host applications and plug-ins (also known as OpenFX and OFX).
### Editor
An application which allows you to manipulate a video timeline by adding, removing, and changing the in and out points of video clips. Effects, Generators, Transition, Compositors and Retiming effects are commonly used in editors.
### Compositor
An application which allows you build a video clip by layering video clips, still images, and effects.

## About the Open Effects Association

The Open Effects Association (OFX), a non-profit organization, develops and promotes open standards across the visual effects community. The founding members come from Assimilate, Autodesk, Digieffects, FilmLight, The Foundry, GenArts and RE:Vision FX. These are companies which have helped artists create ground-breaking VFX shots on nearly every blockbuster movie.

The Association's initial focus is to improve the OpenFX image processing plug-in standard. This goal of this standard is to reduce development effort and support needed for plug-ins across different compositing and editing host platforms.

# Building

You can build the examples, support lib, and host support lib using Conan and CMake

## Prerequisites

Install conan and cmake:
- Mac: `brew install cmake conan`
- Windows: `choco install cmake conan`
- Linux: `apt install cmake conan`
For all OSes, you can instead install conan using `pip3 install conan` if you have python3 installed.

## Build

On all OSes, use the same process:

```sh
% conan install -if Build . # install dependencies from conanfile.py
% cmake -S . -B Build -DBUILD_EXAMPLE_PLUGINS=1 # configure cmake to build into Build folder
% cmake --build Build
```

This should build with the default Visual Studio on Windows and
Makefiles with gcc on Linux and Mac. You can use alternative build
systems supported by CMake like `ninja` if you want (not covered
here).
