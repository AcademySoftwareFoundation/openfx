  This value may be less than the actual number of Threads on a machine, as the host may reserve other CPU ressources for itself.
  The host might want to say how many threads the plugin can use to do whatever it is it is doing. In that way you can stop a plugin over-subscribing the number of cores available.
  A computer can have a number of CPU (e.g. 1-4), each CPU can have a number of CORES (e.g. 2-8) and each core can have a number of HYPER-THREADS (often 2, i.e. hyper-threading), 
  thus nThreads max allocated by host will refers to the number of hyperthreads: nThreads = CPU X CORES X HYPER-THREADS. 
  And the host who allocates a Pool Thread will return to you a value of 1 to nThreads.

  Note, it should really be called multiThreadNumCPUs but naming kept for backward compatibility simplicity
