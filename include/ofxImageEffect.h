     - 0 - for a plugin, indicates that a plugin does not need to be sequentially rendered to be correct, for a host, indicates that it cannot ever guarantee sequential rendering,

Some effects have temporal dependancies, some information from from the rendering of frame N-1 is needed to render frame N correctly. This property is set by an effect to indicate such a situation. Also, some effects are more efficient if they run sequentially, but can still render correct images even if they do not, eg: a complex particle system.

During an interactive session a host may attempt to render a frame out of sequence (for example when the user scrubs the current time), and the effect needs to deal with such a situation as best it can to provide feedback to the user.

However if a host caches output, any frame frame generated in random temporal order needs to be considered invalid and needs to be re-rendered when the host finally performs a first to last render of the output sequence.

In all cases, a host will set the kOfxImageEffectPropSequentialRenderStatus flag to indicate its sequential render status.

  \arg memoryHandle - memory handle returned by imageMemoryAlloc

  This function frees a memory handle and associated memory that was previously allocated via OfxImageEffectSuiteV1::imageMemoryAlloc

  If there are outstanding locks, these are ignored and the handle and memory are freed anyway.

  See \ref ImageEffectsMemoryAllocation.

  \arg memoryHandle - memory handle returned by imageMemoryAlloc
  \arg returnedPtr - where to the pointer to the locked memory

  This function locks them memory associated with a memory handle and returns a pointer to it. The memory will be 16 byte aligned, to allow use of vector operations.
  
  Note that memory locks and unlocks nest.

  After the first lock call, the contents of the memory pointer to by \e returnedPtr is undefined. All subsequent calls to lock will return memory with the same contents as  the previous call.

  Also, if unlocked, then relocked, the memory associated with a memory handle may be at a different address.

  See also OfxImageEffectSuiteV1::imageMemoryUnlock and \ref ImageEffectsMemoryAllocation.
    
  @returns
  - kOfxStatOK if the memory was locked, a pointer is placed in \e returnedPtr
  - kOfxStatErrBadHandle if the value of \e memoryHandle was not a valid pointer returned by OfxImageEffectSuiteV1::imageMemoryAlloc, null is placed in \e *returnedPtr
  - kOfxStatErrMemory if there was not enough memory to satisfy the call, \e *returnedPtr is set to NULL

  /** @brief Unlock allocated image data

  \arg allocatedData - pointer to memory previously returned by OfxImageEffectSuiteV1::imageAlloc

  This function unlocks a previously locked memory handle. Once completely unlocked, memory associated with a memoryHandle is no longer available for use. Attempting to use it results in undefined behaviour.

  Note that locks and unlocks nest, and to fully unlock memory you need to match the count of locks placed upon it. 

  Also note, if you unlock a completely unlocked handle, it has no effect (ie: the lock count can't be negative).
    
  If unlocked, then relocked, the memory associated with a memory handle may be at a different address, however the contents will remain the same.

  See also OfxImageEffectSuiteV1::imageMemoryLock and \ref ImageEffectsMemoryAllocation.
  
  @returns
  - kOfxStatOK if the memory was unlocked cleanly,
  - kOfxStatErrBadHandle if the value of \e memoryHandle was not a valid pointer returned by OfxImageEffectSuiteV1::imageMemoryAlloc, null is placed in \e *returnedPtr
